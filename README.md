# Note-Taker
This repository represents my submission for the module 11 challenge to add a back end onto a note taker app. 

## Description
The following program is designed to meet the requirements of the Module 11 Challenge. It represents the beginnings of a Note Taker web application. Users can view, add, or delete notes. Upon selecting the 'Getting Started' button, user are taken to the notes page where they can view their notes. Old notes can be viewed by selecting the note titles on the left side of the page. New notes can be added by updating the designated text entry boxes on the right side of the page. Notes can be deleted by selecting the trash can icon next to the stored note titles.
